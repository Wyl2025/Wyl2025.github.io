## About

The Chat Application Project is a Python-based chat system consisting of two main components: a server and a client. The server handles multiple client connections and broadcasts messages sent by clients to all other connected users. The client communicates with the server to send and receive messages, and the GUI is built using Pygame.

This project serves as a practical demonstration of basic networking principles, multi-threading, and GUI development.

## Installation

To install and run the chat application locally, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/username/projectname.git
